# bme68x-python-library-bsec2.2.0-13sensors
This project is a clone of the PI3G python library supporting the BOSCH Sensortec BME688 -BSEC 2.2.0.0 : 13 v-sensors
At BSEC 2.2.0 Boschsensortec removed a virtual sensor perviously annotated for "internal use". This version removes all aspects of that sensor from the PI3G BSEC module.
